# EpicStaff - AI Agent Without The Frustration

You wanted to build smart AI agents.
But instead, you got stuck in YAML files. Debugging configs. Fighting workflows. Losing time

**EpicStaff fixes that**

**EpicStaff** is an open-source platform for building agent-based AI systems with maximum flexebility and minimum friction.
With **EpicStaff**, you can create AI agents that work quickly and efficiently, remember the context of your tasks, and can make decisions based on the information they receive.

We built EpicStaff because we've seen the gap and offers a dual-approach platform:

üîπFor non-technical users:

An intuitive visual interface for designing and exucuting AI agent workflows - without requiring YAML or programming knowledge.

üîπFor developers:

A modular, transparent backend that enables fine-grained control and direct access to orchestration logic.

Whether you're experementing, prototyping, or deploying to production, EpicStaff adapts to your team:

- Use drag and drop when needed
- Dive into code when preferred
- Or combine both, seamlessly

We hide the comlexity, not the logic.
