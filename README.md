# EpicStaff - AI Agent Without The Frustration

AI agent don't need to be complicated. EpicStaff gives teams visual workflows and developers full backend control - in one platform.

---

**EpicStaff** is an open-source platform for building agent-based AI systems with maximum flexebility and minimum friction.
With **EpicStaff**, you can create AI agents that work quickly and efficiently, remember the context of your tasks and can make decisions based on the information they receive.

## We built EpicStaff because we've seen the gap and offers a dual-approach platform:

### 🔹For non-technical users:

Create multitasking AI agents through an intuitive interface. Use node-based programming frameworks to connect blocks in charge of actions: text analysis, response generation, working with files and CRM systems, etc.

### 🔹For developers:

A modular, transparent backend that enables fine-grained control and direct access to orchestration logic.

Whether you're experementing, prototyping, or deploying to production, EpicStaff adapts to your team:

- Use drag and drop when needed
- Dive into code when preferred
- Or combine both, seamlessly

We hide the comlexity, not the logic.

## 🎯 Who is EpicStaff ideal for?

- AI developers who desire flexibility without templates

- Business teams who wish to quickly create functional AI agents

- No-code users who prefer an interface over YAML

- R&D teams and startups working with agent systems
